#Image Processor
This is an image processing application written in MATLAB written by Jason Chan. It can take any .jpg file as input
Effects include grayscale, dithering, blurring and sharpening.
Some sample images are included.

## Run instruction:
1) Open the layout0.m file in MATLAB (I used ver. R2016b)
2) Hit "Run" or f5
3) Select a jpg file (There are a few under the "input_images" sub-directory)
