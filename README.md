# Image Processor
This is an image processing application written in MATLAB. Effects include grayscale, dithering, blurring and sharpening. See samples for more details. 


## Run Instructions
This can process any .jpg file as input. 
1) Open the layout0.m file in MATLAB (I used ver. R2016b)
2) Hit "Run" or f5
3) Select a jpg file (There are a few under the "input_images" sub-directory)
